# wpfTreeView
Simple Treeview program to map all the drives, directories and folders in a machine.
alone this project has no real use, but an example of how it can be used in all operationg systems.
because windows, linux and ios all use similar projects to map their file, e.g file explorer in windows. 

# To run:
Build The project
you simply open the application (.exe) file in the bin folder.

**the code is much more complex than is seen in the form so i suggest you take a look at that too.**
